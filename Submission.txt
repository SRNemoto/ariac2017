The code works by subscribing to the topic /ariac/logical_camera for the
poses of the piston parts and the camera. It also subscribes to the topic
/ariac/orders to get orders. From the logical camera messages, it takes 
the pose of the piston parts then uses tfBuffer.lookupTransform() to get 
the transformation from the logical camera frame to the world frame.
After that, it uses tf2::doTransform() to apply the logical camera frame
to world transformation to the piston part's pose. Then, the move group's
goal pose is set to the piston part's pose (in the world frame). Finally,
the moveit planning interface is used to plan a path to the goal pose.
Once that is completed, the program exits.
